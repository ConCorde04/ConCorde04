## About This Project

This repository contains my implementation of **Huffman Coding**, which is an example of **efficient algorithm design** used for encoding data based on its frequency. Through this project, I’ve gained deeper insights into how data structures and algorithms can optimize processes in fields like **data transmission** and **information retrieval**.

### Key Features:
- Constructs a **Huffman Tree** for assigning optimized codes to characters.
- Generates **Huffman codes** based on character frequency in a given input.
- Provides functions to **encode and decode** text using this approach.

### What I’ve Learned:
This project helped me refine my skills in:
- Designing and implementing **efficient algorithms** for real-world applications.
- Using **binary trees** and **priority queues** to optimize operations.
- Applying algorithmic concepts to build solutions that can be integrated into **larger systems** (e.g., data transmission, secure communication).

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ConCorde04/huffman-coding.git
